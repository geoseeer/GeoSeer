## How It Works

1. **Upload Image** 📤 — Upload an image via the [web interface](https://geoseeer.com) or the [REST API](https://geoseeer.com/api-docs). Supports file upload (JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC) and image URLs.
2. **AI Analysis** 🤖 — GeoSeer's agentic analysis system examines visual clues — architectural styles, natural landmarks, vegetation patterns, street furniture, signage, satellite data, and environmental context.
3. **Location Results** 📍 — Receive up to 8 location candidates ranked by confidence, each with GPS coordinates, human-readable address, and detailed reasoning explaining the analysis.

### Architecture Overview

GeoSeer's agentic pipeline consists of two complementary analysis paths:

- **Fast Mode (GS-Fast)** — Proprietary geospatial estimation for rapid kilometer-level predictions
- **Agent Mode (GS-Agent)** — Multi-step reasoning and tool calling for more comprehensive pinpointing

Shared system components include:

- **Input Processing** — Image ingestion with metadata extraction (EXIF data, timestamps, camera info)
- **Model Estimation** — Proprietary geospatial estimation model used by GS-Fast and as a signal source for deeper analysis
- **LVLM Analysis** — Large Vision-Language Model analysis for feature extraction and scene understanding
- **Normalization & Reasoning** — Multi-step reasoning that integrates signals from all sources
- **Tool Calling** — Satellite imagery, map data, web search, and reverse image search for verification
- **Final Reasoning** — Comprehensive analysis combining all evidence into precise location candidates
